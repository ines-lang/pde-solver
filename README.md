# Synthetic PDE Dataset Generator

## Description

This project enables the generation of synthetic datasets for one-, two-, and three-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) with **fully customizable parameters**. The implementation covers a wide range of classical PDEs that exhibit turbulence, pattern formation, chaos, shocks, and reactionâ€“diffusion dynamics.

The solver is built on [**Exponax**](https://github.com/exponax/exponax) (JAX-based spectral solvers) and extended with a specialized implementation of the **2D Kolmogorov flow** solver ([Controlling-Kolmogorov-Flow](https://github.com/smokbel/Controlling-Kolmogorov-Flow)).

By generating **high-resolution trajectories** of these PDEs, the tool provides a foundation for research in:
- Scientific machine learning  
- Surrogate modeling and forecasting  
- Operator learning  
- Data-driven analysis of nonlinear dynamics

## Supported PDEs

The following PDEs are currently supported:

- **Burgers equation** â€“ nonlinear advection + viscosity (turbulence/shocks)  
- **Kuramotoâ€“Sivashinsky (KS)** â€“ chaotic and unstable dynamics (1D/2D); **also includes the conservative KS variant in 1D**.
- **Kortewegâ€“de Vries equation** â€“ soliton propagation  
- **Kolmogorov flow (2D)** â€“ spectral Navierâ€“Stokes model with forcing  
- **Grayâ€“Scott model** â€“ reactionâ€“diffusion patterns (spots, stripes)  
- **Fisherâ€“KPP equation** â€“ traveling wave fronts and population dynamics  
- **Swiftâ€“Hohenberg equation** â€“ pattern formation near criticality  
- **Navierâ€“Stokes (vorticity form)** â€“ 2D turbulence with convection and drag  
- **Allenâ€“Cahn equation** â€“ phase separation with double-well potential  
- **Cahnâ€“Hilliard equation** â€“ phase separation with mass conservation  

Each PDE comes with **compatible initial conditions (ICs)** such as:
- `RandomTruncatedFourierSeries`  
- `SpectralFlow` (Kolmogorov)  
- `RandomGaussianBlobs` (Grayâ€“Scott)  
- `ClampedFourier` (Fisherâ€“KPP)  
- `GaussianRandomField`, `DiffusedNoise` (Swiftâ€“Hohenberg)

## Data Organization

Running `generate_dataset.py` automatically creates a directory structure organized by PDE and initial condition (IC). The hierarchy looks like this:

```
2D/
â”œâ”€â”€ generate_dataset.py
â”œâ”€â”€ stepper.py
â”œâ”€â”€ pde/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ic/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ dataset.h5
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.json
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ plots/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ seed_000_channel_0.mp4 
```

- **`dataset.h5`**  
  The main simulation output. Each group corresponds to a PDE parameterization (e.g. `nu_0.010`, `Re_250.000`, `feed_0.028_kill_0.056`). Inside each group, trajectories are saved as datasets (`velocity_seed000`, `state_seed001`, etc.), with shape:
  
  (C, T, H[, W[, D]])
  
  where `C` = channels, `T` = time steps, `H/W/D` = spatial dimensions.

- **`plots/`**  
Contains `.png` snapshots and `.mp4` animations of some simulations, grouped by channel. This allows quick inspection of qualitative dynamics.

- **`metadata.json`**  
A structured record of all parameters, solver details, initial condition generation, and global statistics. This ensures full reproducibility and makes dataset sharing easier.

---

## Output Format

Simulation trajectories are stored as HDF5 datasets with the structure:

B Ã— C Ã— T Ã— H [Ã— W [Ã— D]]


- **B**: number of simulations (batch size)    
- **C**: number of channels (scalar field(s) per PDE)  
- **T**: number of saved time steps
- **H/W/D**: spatial dimensions  

Each dataset is grouped by PDE parameters (e.g., viscosity, Reynolds number, reaction rates). Example group names:

- Burgers: `nu_0.010`  
- Kolmogorov: `Re_250.000`  
- Grayâ€“Scott: `feed_0.028_kill_0.056`  
- Cahnâ€“Hilliard: `nu_1.0e-02_gamma_1.0e-03`  # TODO: check if it is with e notation

## Running the Generator

The entry point is `generate_dataset.py`, which supports two modes:

1. **Default parameters**  
   Run without arguments to use the defaults defined in the script:
   ```bash
   python generate_dataset.py
   ```

2. **Custom configuration**  
   Provide a JSON file with your parameters (faster):
   ```bash
   python generate_dataset.py --config metadata.json
   ```
   Example `metadata.json` files are provided in the repository for each PDE and dimension.  
   For more details on repository layout and code structure, see the section *File Structure*.

   The following parameters can be specified through the argparse configuration:

   - `num_spatial_dims`, `pde`, `ic`, `bc`  
   - `x_domain_extent`, `num_points`, `dt_save`, `t_end`, `save_freq`  
   - `nu`, `Re`, `reactivity`, `critical_wavenumber`  
   - `feed_rate`, `kill_rate`, `vorticity_convection_scale`, `drag`  
   - `gamma`, `c1`, `c3`  
   - `simulations`, `plotted_sim`, `plot_sim`, `stats`, `seed`  

   Note: in 1D and 3D configurations, some parameters may not apply.

   For example, some variables recorded in the metadata cannot be changed directly through it, such as the `cmap` or animation-related settings (e.g., whether the visualization is `physical`, `fixed`, etc.).

In both modes, the script generates:

- `dataset.h5` â€” simulation trajectories  
- `metadata.json` â€” full record of parameters and solver details  
- `plots/` â€” PNG/MP4 visualizations of selected runs

## File Structure

To generate datasets, you need a working directory organized by **dimension** (e.g., `1D/`, `2D/`, or `3D/`). Inside each dimension folder, place the following components:

- **`generate_dataset.py`**  
  Main script and user-facing entry point. It parses parameters, launches simulations, saves results, and produces plots and statistics.

- **`stepper.py`**  
  Defines the PDE-specific steppers, initial conditions, and rollout logic for each supported equation.

- **Solver dependencies**  
  The code relies on two external solver libraries:
  - [**Exponax**](https://github.com/exponax/exponax): a JAX-based pseudo-spectral solver framework.  
  - [**Controlling-Kolmogorov-Flow**](https://github.com/smokbel/Controlling-Kolmogorov-Flow): only used in `/2D`.

### Example layout for 2D simulations

```
2D/
â”œâ”€â”€ generate_dataset.py
â”œâ”€â”€ stepper.py
â”œâ”€â”€ exponax/    
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ etdrk/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ic/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ metrics/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...        # other submodules
â””â”€â”€ kolmogorov_flow/
    â””â”€â”€ Controlling_Kolmogorov_Flow/
        â”œâ”€â”€ equations/
        â”œâ”€â”€ gym/
        â””â”€â”€ ...        # other submodules

```
Where folders containing the solvers are saved at the same level as the python running files.

## Notes and Recommendations

- **Boundary conditions**: No explicit boundary conditions are needed, as the Exponax solver is implemented in JAX and uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) internally. For consistency, set the boundary condition parameter to 'None'.
- Although the user interface allows the definition of `y_domain_extent` and `z_domain_extent` for 2D and 3D cases, the solvers internally rely only on `x_domain_extent`, which is treated as the full spatial extent of the domain. As a result, the effective domain size is always determined by `x_domain_extent`, and editing `y_domain_extent` or `z_domain_extent` has no effect on the simulation and it is not really necesarily.
- **Performance**: simulations are accelerated with JAX; NumPy is used for CPU-side dataset assembly.  
- Each simulation is initialized with a user-defined seed from the `seed_list`. Reproducibility is guaranteed only if the same `seed_list` is used across runs. By default, the list starts from `seed=42`, but this can be customized by the user.

- **3D support**: implemented for Burgers and KS; visualization utilities are still under development. 
- **Visualizations in 3D: CLI**:  The `viz_dataset.py` tool (in `3D/`) provides a command-line interface that can render time-series from HDF5 into PNG frames and MP4 videos.
