# 2D
To generate datasets in two dimensions, run **`generate_dataset.py`** from within the `2D/` folder.  
This ensures that the output directories are created correctly.

The resulting datasets can be found at:

The solver used for Kolmogorov flow is located in  
`/pde-solver/2D/kolmogorov_flow`.  
It was obtained from
